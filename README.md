# listtool
a small webapp for quickly comparing two lists

## Purpose

I often need to compare various lists at work and at home,
i.e. I want to know which elements are just in one of both (and if, in which)
and which are contained in both of the lists.

I didn't find a solution for this problem
(although I'm sure it exists a million times out there), so
I decided to do a quick'n'dirty tool on my own.

## Implementation & Use

Implemented as a very simple standalone web app,
using Bootstrap and some HTML5 and Vanilla JS.
Use it locally or host it somewhere.

## License

Not sure yet, the tool is under development â€” I will add some open license soon,
I promise. Anyway, feel free to use.
